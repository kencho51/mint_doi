To facilitate informed public health decisions, the concerned parties rely on short-term daily projections generated via predictive modeling.

Widespread adoption has seen HTSlib downloaded &amp;gt;1 million times from GitHub and conda. The C library has been used directly by an estimated 900 GitHub projects and has been incorporated into Perl, Python, Rust, and R, significantly expanding the number of uses via other languages.
